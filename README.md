# 📊 Customer Behavior Data Analytics Project

## **Overview**

This project showcases a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow. It covers loading a dataset in Python, performing exploratory data analysis, cleaning the data, analyzing it using SQL queries in MySQL, building an interactive Power BI dashboard, and presenting final insights using Gamma. The goal is to understand customer purchasing behavior and generate insights that support business decisions.

## **Dataset**

The dataset includes customer-level information such as purchased items, purchase dates, transaction amounts, discount usage, previous purchase behavior, and review ratings.
Key features analyzed include:

* Customer purchase activity
* Discount usage
* Repeat behavior vs new customers
* Spending patterns
* Ratings and feedback

---

## **Tools & Technologies**

* **Python (JupyterLab):** Data loading, EDA, data cleaning
* **MySQL:** Running analytical SQL queries
* **Power BI:** Dashboard creation
* **Gamma:** Report and final presentation
* **Excel/CSV:** Raw dataset format

---

## **Project Steps**

### **1. Data Loading & Understanding (Python)**

The dataset was imported into Python and inspected to understand structure, column types, and potential issues. Summary statistics and distributions were reviewed.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Performed analysis to understand patterns such as:

* Most purchased products
* Spending distribution
* Rating patterns
* Customer frequency patterns

Visualizations were created to reveal trends and potential issues.

### **3. Data Cleaning**

The dataset was cleaned by:

* Handling missing values
* Removing duplicates
* Fixing inconsistent entries
* Converting data types
* Creating additional useful fields (customer segments, date parts, etc.)

This cleaned dataset was used for SQL and BI analysis.

---

## **4. SQL Analysis (MySQL)**

The cleaned data was imported into MySQL where structured queries were performed to answer business questions such as:

* Which products are purchased most frequently
* Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)
* Discount usage behavior
* Purchase frequency patterns
* Revenue distribution across segments

Results help identify which customer groups and behaviors contribute most to business outcomes.

---

## **5. Power BI Dashboard**

A fully interactive dashboard was created that includes:

* Customer segmentation view
* Product performance metrics
* Discount usage trends
* Revenue trends
* Ratings and satisfaction analysis

The dashboard allows business stakeholders to visually explore customer behavior insights.

---

## **6. Report & Presentation (Gamma)**

A polished presentation summarizing the project, insights, dashboard highlights, and business recommendations was created using Gamma.

---

## **Key Results & Insights**

* Loyal customers contribute the highest revenue
* Discount usage significantly increases purchase likelihood
* Certain products dominate total sales volume
* Ratings correlate with repeat behavior
* Returning customers show high retention potential

These insights support marketing, pricing, and customer retention strategies.

## **How to Run This Project**

1. Open the project notebook in JupyterLab to review data loading, EDA, and cleaning steps.
2. Import the cleaned dataset into MySQL using MySQL Workbench.
3. Run SQL queries to analyze customer behavior.
4. Open the Power BI file and refresh data to view all dashboards.
5. Review the final insights presentation created in Gamma.
